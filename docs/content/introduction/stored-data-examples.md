# Data stored in OmicsDM

OmicsDM was designed to store the following two data types:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

  -   :dna:{ .lg .middle } __Omics Data__

    ---

    Omics data is a high-throughput data type that is generated by
    technologies such as DNA/RNA-seq, proteomics, metabolomics etc.

    !!! Warning "3TR specific"
        Only submit processed data that is ready for analyses.

  -   :fontawesome-solid-clipboard-user:{ .lg .middle } __Pheno-Clinical Data__

    ---

    Pheno-clinical (phenotypic + clinical) data is the data that describes the phenotype and clinical
    information of the samples from which the omics data was generated.
    
    In the best scenario, this data comes in the form of 
    [GA4GH](https://www.ga4gh.org/){target="_blank"} standards such as:
    
    [Phenopackets v2](https://www.ga4gh.org/product/phenopackets/){target="_blank"} 
    or [Beacon-friendly-format](https://b2ri-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

## Omics Data Example

### RNA-seq Data Example from CELLxGENE

In the python ecosystem one of the most used tool for single-cell RNA-seq data analysis is
[Scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/){target="_blank"}, which is built on top of
[AnnData](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/){target="_blank"}. The latter is a data structure
for storing annotated data matrices, which can be saved to disk in the form of a `.h5ad` file.

Thus, you find below a `.h5ad` example, which not only can be stored in OmicsDM but also be explored 
using OmicsDM's [visualisation module](./functionalities-organized-in-modules.md/#data-visualisation).

!!! Info "3TR specific"
    The visualisation module is disabled in the 3TR instance of OmicsDM.

## Pheno-Clinical Data Example

### Pheno-Clinical Information Exported from REDCap

In the [3TR project](https://www.3tr-imi.eu) most of the Pheno-clinical information is stored in [REDCap](https://www.project-redcap.org/){target="_blank"}, a widely adopted web application for building and managing online surveys and database.
The information is then exported in the form of two CSV files. Click on each link to see an example of the content of the files:

- [REDCap data export](https://github.com/CNAG-Biomedical-Informatics/convert-pheno/blob/main/t/redcap2bff/in/redcap_data.csv){target="_blank"}
- [REDCap data dictionary export](https://github.com/CNAG-Biomedical-Informatics/convert-pheno/blob/main/t/redcap2bff/in/redcap_dictionary.csv){target="_blank"}
