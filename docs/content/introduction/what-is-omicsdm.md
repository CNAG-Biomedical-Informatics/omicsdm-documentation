# What is OmicsDM?

OmicsDM is an **open-source** web-based data warehouse solution that 
not only allows the storage and sharing of data 
but also provides functionalities to start data visualisation instances 
such as [CELLxGENE Annotate](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/cellxgene) 
and run analyses directly in the data warehouse.
