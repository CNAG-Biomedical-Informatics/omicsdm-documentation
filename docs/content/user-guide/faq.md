??? faq "After uploading I realised that there is a mistake in the file. Can I correct it?"

    No, you cannot overwite the uploaded file. Best is to upload the again with the correct data making sure it has the same name as the original file. The system will automatically version the file. To avoid confusion, you can mark the original file as "deleted" so the users only have access to the correct file.

??? faq "I accidentaly uploaded a wrong file, can I delete it?"

    No, you cannot delete any uploaded file (refer to [File deletion](../../concepts/distributed-file-storage/#file-deletion)). Best is to mark the file as "deleted" so no one can access it. If the file contains sensitive data, please explain the situation in an email to the helpdesk.
