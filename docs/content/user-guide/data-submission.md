# Data Submission

## General



## 3TR specific

### Molecular data

!!! Warning "The data warehouse is not a storage for your raw data"
    Please do not see our data warehouse as a storage for your raw data.
    Only upload processed data that is ready for analyses.

Under molecular data falls all kinds of omics data, such as RNA-seq count matrices.

### Pheno-clinical data

Since the molecular data cannot be interpreted without the context of the patient,
it is crucial to also store the pheno-clinical (phenotypic + clinical) 
information about the patients.

!!! Trivia "Format of the already uploaded data"
    - Legacy data: Raw CSV
    - In 3TR produced data: REDCap exports (CSV)
