In the context of the 3TR project, there are two main types of data that are stored in OmicsDM.
Processed omics data and patient's pheno-clinical information.

### Processed omics data

!!! Warning "The data warehouse is not a storage for your raw data"
    Please do not see our data warehouse as a storage for your raw data.
    Only upload processed data that is ready for analyses.

### Patient's pheno-clinical information

The patient's pheno-clinical information is stored in the data warehouse to allow the linking of the omics data to the patient's clinical information.
