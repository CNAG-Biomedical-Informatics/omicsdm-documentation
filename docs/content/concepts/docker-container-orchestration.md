# Docker container orchestration

OmicsDM employs [Docker](https://www.docker.com) containers to provide private data visualisaton environments to its users.
These containers are ochestrated employing ShinyProxy, a Java-based web application that was initially developed by Open Analytics
to deploy Shiny applications. However, in meantime, ShinyProxy has evolved to support any other containerised applications as well.
