# About

## Development
<div class="grid cards" markdown>

OmicsDM started as a PhD project of [Ivo Christopher Leist](https://github.com/IvoLeist){target="_blank"}
at [CNAG](https://www.cnag.eu){target="_blank"} in 2020. It was initially developed to serve
as a flexible and scalable **data storage and sharing solution** of processed **omics data**
and its patient's **clinical information** for the [3TR](https://www.3tr-imi.eu){target="_blank"} consortium.
Since Q1 2022 it is in production use by 3TR. Over the years, 3rd-party tools have been integrated
to provide (a) data visualisation and (b) analysis capabilities.
